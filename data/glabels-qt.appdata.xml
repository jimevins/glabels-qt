  <summary>Create labels, business cards and media covers</summary>
  <description>
    <p>gLabels is a program for creating labels and business cards. It is
    designed to work with various laser/ink-jet peel-off label and business
    card sheets that you'll find at most office supply stores.</p>
    <p>gLabels can be used to design address labels, name tags, price tags,
    cd/dvd labels, or just about anything else that is organized in a regular
    pattern on a sheet of paper. Labels (or cards) can contain text, images,
    lines, shapes, and barcodes. gLabels also includes a document-merge feature
    which lets you print a unique label for each record from an external data
    source, such as a CSV file.</p>
